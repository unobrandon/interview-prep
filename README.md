# Swift Algorithm Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides essential Swift code templates and explanations for a variety of fundamental and advanced algorithmic problems. It is designed as a quick reference to help you solve common algorithm challenges efficiently in Swift.

## Content Overview

- **Arrays & Strings**: Covers common techniques like sliding window, two-pointer approaches, sorting algorithms, prefix sums, and array/string traversal strategies.
- **Linked Lists**: Includes implementations for efficient linked list manipulation, cycle detection, merging sorted lists, and in-place modifications.
- **Hash Tables**: Shows how to leverage hash tables for quick data retrieval and includes implementations of popular caching mechanisms like LRU.
- **Recursion & Dynamic Programming**: Demonstrates recursive problem-solving techniques, memoization, and dynamic programming patterns that optimize performance.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Provides templates for sorting, including binary search, quicksort, mergesort, and counting sort.
- **Matrix Operations**: Explores common operations such as creating, transposing, and traversing matrices for grid-based problems.
- **Tree Traversals**: Covers in-order, pre-order, post-order, and level-order traversal techniques for binary trees and general trees.
- **Graph Theory**: Contains templates for representing graphs, performing depth-first and breadth-first search, as well as advanced algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s for shortest paths and topological sorting.
- **Advanced Data Structures**: Introduces the Trie data structure for prefix trees, disjoint sets for union-find operations, and heap structures for managing priority queues.
- **Popular Algorithms**: Includes efficient solutions to well-known problems such as Kadane's Algorithm for maximum subarrays, sliding window techniques for optimal subsequence finding, and the monotonic stack for handling specific sequence problems.
